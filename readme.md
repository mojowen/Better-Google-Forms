Better Google Forms
=============

Better Google Forms is a plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) that makes it easy to add the straight-html necessary for embedding a Google Form. Accept no iframes!

Installation
-------

1. Download source to your WordPress plugin directory /wp-content/plugins
2. Visit Administration Panels > Plugins form the Admin Console and activate the plugin
3. Go to a Post / Page editor and add from the WYSIWYG

Yes Please!

My list of things I'd like to do:

 * Add a widget
 * Get some sort of AJAX-form submission. This is sort of problematic when you've got complicated required fields and validation. I just don't want to fuck with it (yet)
 * Maybe update fields when the form is updated? Maybe this doesn't matter

Acknowledgements
------------

* The tool also uses [Simple HTML DOM Library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/) by S.C. Chen
* Also utilizes [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* Developed by the nonpartisan nonprofits the [Bus Federation](http://busfederation.com) & [Bus Project](http://busproject.org).
